## Wangkanai Solver

Mathematical optimization and simulation and modeling solver which seeks to find the best solution to a given problem out of very large dataset. This would enable us find the optimal maximal or minimal value of a given functions, and model complex systems by using decision variables and constraints.

The goals might be overwhelming and going to have a lot challenges ahead. While this is project has roots back 20 years ago during my bachelor degree do project thesis on management information system, seeking to find the optimum manufacturing production capacity planning. I understand that this project very much ambitious to solve alone and would like everyone to help me on my journey.
